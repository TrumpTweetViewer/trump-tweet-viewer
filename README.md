# Trump Tweet Viewer

With Trump's twitter account now permanently banned, the internet is filled with news articles referencing tweets that no longer exist on Twitter and old articles with [link rot](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222371/trump-ban-twitter-link-rot-embedded-dead-posts). 
With Trump Tweet Viewer, you can click on any Trump twitter link and see the original tweet as it was posted, thus restoring context to these news articles. 

This extension also redirects attempts to view Trump's twitter homepage to the Factbase Trump twitter database.
